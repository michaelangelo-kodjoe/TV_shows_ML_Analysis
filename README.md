# TV_shows_ML_Analysis

## Overview of Project
This project is a Natural Language Processing classification of the TV Shows reviews as an input data for machine learning algorithm to predict movie ranking score


## Reasons for selecting the topic: 
* Possibility to use NLP
* Everybody likes TV shows
* Good database with two different reviews with match ranking was available

## Description of the source of data: 

Kaggle website - a subsidiary of Google LLC, is an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners. Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges. To process that we will use NRCLex library that measures the emotional effect from a body of text. This gives frequencies of words with particular emotions in the database. We will use this as a input for neural network model to predict meta_score of the tv show.

## Questions to to answer with the data: 
* Is NLP emotion classification able to predict TV show ranking score?
* Is it more useful for predicting critics or viewers score?
* Do review sources differ in emotion classification percentage?
