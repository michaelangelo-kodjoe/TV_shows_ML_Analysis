The Office tells a story of a few people working in a British office working hard to not lose their jobs. This hilarious comedy won a Golden Globe award for best comedy series. It was created by Ricky Gervais and Steve Merchant. David Brent (Ricky Gervais) is a manager of low intelligence and has no sense of humor, but is convinced that he is the best, the most entertaining and the most well liked boss of all time.Today the show has been sold in more than 60 countries and it even had a remake in America. The Office is the first non-American show nominated in the category of best television musical or comedy for a Golden Globe Award; and Ricky Gervais was the first non-American actor nominated for the lead role in a television comedy for the same award. The Office won both awards and left Sex and the City & Matt LeBlanc empty handed. When the series aired the first season, they did not even know how popular it would get in some future episodes. The fact that its release on the DVD format proved to be the BBC's best selling comedy release shows its mass popularity and appeal.The writers at the start did not imagine that a second season would be created and after bowing to pressure to create one they would not do it again for a third.
